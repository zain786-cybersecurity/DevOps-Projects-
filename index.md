## 📦 PROJECTS – DevOps & Automation

### Project 1
### 🚀 CI Pipeline for Python Application
<div class="project-block">

**Goal:**  
Create a fully automated **Continuous Integration (CI)** pipeline using GitHub Actions to test and validate a Python application on every push or pull request.

**What it does**  
- Automatically triggers on commits to the `main` branch  
- Checks out the repository code  
- Sets up Python 3.10 in the CI runner  
- Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`  
- Runs automated tests using `pytest`  
- Shows pass/fail results directly in the "Actions" tab  
- Ensures consistent quality and prevents broken code from being merged  

**Why this matters**  
This pipeline mimics real DevOps workflows used in production teams, enforcing code quality, reliability, and automated testing. It demonstrates core CI/CD skills required for DevOps & DevSecOps roles.

**Tech Stack / Tools Used**  
> GitHub Actions • CI/CD • Python 3.10 • PyTest • YAML Workflows • Ubuntu Runner • Requirements Management
